# Italian-University-Exposure
Passive reconnaissance project focused on mapping and assessing the online attack surface of Italian universities. The analysis identifies critical exposures, outdated systems, and administrative portals accessible from the Internet, providing a real-world overview of systemic vulnerabilities within academic infrastructures.
